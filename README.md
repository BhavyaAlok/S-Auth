#S-Auth

##  Motivation
OTP often arrives after its verification period has expired, possibly because of bad cellular connectivity (network hindrance) or server overload. 

## Objective
To implement a Time-based OTP that runs on both server and client to generate the same OTP synchronously, without the need to be connected to a cellular network.
Implement an Android application that generates the same OTP as a server, without being connected to cellular networks.
Implementation of a website that generates the same OTP and also, can authenticate the OTP entered by the user.


## Implementation Methodology
### Android Application (Client Side): 
] Inside the Application Separate Classes for HMAC Algorithm, HOTP, and TOTP were made.
] They were fed a seed manually generated by the server.
] Outputs an OTP every 30 seconds.
### Website (Server Side):
] Login Page for individuality.
] Python Backend for generation of OTP synchronously on the Server side.
] Two-factor Authentication using the generated OTP.
        
		
## Learning Outcomes
] Learning about the flaws in the cellular message (SMS) based OTP systems.
] Understanding the HMAC algorithm.
] HOTP generation, (HMAC-based OTP) and TOTP generation, (Time-based OTP)
] Implementation in the form of an Android application and a Web server for testing the idea.
